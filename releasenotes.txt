If it is an array of two markers, the distance between marker m1 and a line spanned by two other markers is computed.

mc2frontal: Amendment to documentation: function applies rotation, not centering (thanks Juan Mendoza)
mccoupling: fix malaprop (canonical component analysis -> canonical correlation analysis)

Note that this also controls state of visibility of a figure produced via mcplotframe, which can be controlled e.g. with the following command: set(gcf,'Visible','on')

Bug fixes
