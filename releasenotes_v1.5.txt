~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 1.2.1

Bug fixes
mcplotframe: plotting frame numbers, no stats toolbox for animationsmcmerge: concatenates marker and trace color strings (if both animations shall have the same colors)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 1.2.2
Bug fixesmcfillgaps: filling of begin and end with first or last recorded marker ('fillall') fixed. New option ('nobefill') that fills gaps during recording, but gaps in start and end are set to NaN instead of 0mcm2j: number of markers set correctly in the joint representationmcplottimeseries: frame scale when plotting norm data mcplottimeseries: plot more than one time series in the same plot using different colorsmcplotframe: frame numbers issue fixedmc2frontal: change marker direction to left to right

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 1.3

New functions
mcboundrect: calculates the bounding rectangle
mccut: cuts two MoCap structures to the length of the shorter onemcfilteremg: filters emg data
mcinitstruct: initializes mocap or norm structure
mcreadmat: reads in .mat files as exported from QTM
mcsegmangle: calculates the angles between two markers 
mcsetmarker: replaces a subset of markers in an existing mocap or norm structure
mcspectrum: Calculates the amplitude spectrum of mocap time series


Bug fixes
mcanimate (1), mcplotframe (1), mcinitanimpar (1): perspective projection implemented
mccumdist: also for data that has already norm structure
mcdemo9: demo on how to use perspective projection in animations
mcfillgaps: bug fixed regarding empty markers/trajectories (being ignored now), bug fixed on input parameter 
mcmerge: now also for norm data
mcperiod: option for either first or highest peak value of autocorrelation 
mcplotframe: png output format when creating animation
mcplottimeseries: plotting of more than one time series in the same plot also possible for norm data (that 'combined' option is very probably not working for segment data) 
mcread: opportunity to read in .mat files as exported from QTM
mcreadc3d: number of frames issue solved (though see note for mcread)
mcreadwii: can handle 6-dof data (order: X Y Z Roll Pitch Yaw) if we publish WiiDataCapture for the motionPlus extension
mcrotate: bug fixed regarding missing markers
mcsmoothen: Butterworth filter smoothing implemented
mctimeder (1): polynomial order and window length dependent on the order of the derivative
mctimeder (2): implementation of faster version based on differences of successive frames
mcwindow: extended for mcvar

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 1.4

New functionsmcc3d2tsv: converts c3d into tsv filemcconcatenate: concatenates markers from different MoCap or norm data structuremcmocapgram: plots mocapgrammcwritetsv: saves a mocap structure as tsv file 

Bug fixesmcdemo1: added new functionality of mcplottimeseriesmcdemo3: code adaption due to new functionality of mcplottimeseriesmcdemo5/9/10: improved explanations and wordingmcdemo11: code adaption due to new functionality of mcplottimeseriesmcdemodata: marker names: spelling and quotation marks fixedmcmerge: color, number, traces, and connection arrays filled up and merged correctlymcperiod: bug fixed related to finding the local maximamcplotframe: color strings internally replaced by RGB triples. User can either specify colors as strings or as RGB triples. Filling up of color, number, traces, and connection arrays (for mcmerge). Warning if frame number exceeds number of frames in datamcplottimeseries: parameter call changed, extension for plotting marker names and labels, using marker/segment names instead of numbers, combined plot option also for segm datamcread: check if input file exists. Support of .mat files (from QTM)mcsetmarker: marker numbers in replacing data set must equal the amount of markers in the vector containing the marker numbers to the replaced. Fix regarding marker namesmctimeder: bug fixed on gap filling for differentiation 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
